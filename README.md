## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to tweak the checkbox input to hide and show elements

### Continued development

I'm planning to create more complex flex and grid layouts. Things to learn from feedback:
- add alt=" " for decorative images and not remove it from img elements. No h1-h6 inside a label tag.
- learn abouth `<detail>` and `<summary>` tags. Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details
- styling of detail tag: https://freefrontend.com/html-details-summary-css/

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/) - This helped me hack a checkbox to create a dropdown menu. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
